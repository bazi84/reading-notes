## My name is Abdulkadir Sheikh

## Growth Mindset in my own words

*To me growth mindset is a continious learning process thru hardwork and dedication. To have open mind and listen the feedback you receive from your failure and to set for yourself ideal goals that will motivate you to continue in your pursuit.

## 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. To remind myself daily why am I pursuing this path
2. what do I want to gain and acheive from this new skills
3. How will it improve and impact my life and the lives of my family*

**Tell yourself daily to Keep up the good work**
