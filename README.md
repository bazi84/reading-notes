## Growth Mindset

*To me growth mindset is a continious learning process thru failure and reviews and set up for myself ideal goals that will motivate me to continue in my pursuit.
1. To remind myself daily why am I pursuing this path
2. what do I want to gain and acheive from this new skills
3. How will it improve and impact my life and the lives of my family*
