JavaScript is a lightwight, interpreted or just in time complied programming language with first class functions. It's also known as the scripting language for Web pages. 

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 

Java is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, impereative and declarative styles.
