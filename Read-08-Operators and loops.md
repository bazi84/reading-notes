# Loops and iteration

*Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:*

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

## The various kind of statements for loops:

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

-   for statement
-   do...while statement
